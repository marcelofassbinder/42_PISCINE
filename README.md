# 42_PISCINE üèäüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
This repository was developed during the 42 Porto Piscine #7 (21/08/2023 to 15/09/2023). The 42 Porto Piscine is an intensive 26-days programming program designed to teach participants Shell Script and C languages. The goal is to prepare students for the selection process at the 42 programming school, where an innovative peer-to-peer learning method is adopted.

# Peer-to-peer Learning ü§ù
A unique aspect of the 42 Porto Piscine is the utilization of peer-to-peer learning. Participants engage in collaborative learning, sharing knowledge, and helping each other grow throughout the program. This collaborative environment fosters a dynamic and interactive learning experience.

# My Journey üöÄ
I entered this process with minimal programming knowledge and skills. The Piscine not only provided a deep dive into the tech world but also allowed me to learn alongside my peers. The peer-to-peer learning approach proved invaluable in my journey from knowing almost nothing about programming to developing projects and facing coding challenges head-on.
Successfully completing this Piscine process has opened the doors for me to join 42, one of the world's premier programming schools. The skills and experiences gained during the Piscine not only prepared me for this opportunity but also solidified my passion for coding.
